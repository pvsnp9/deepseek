    "The influence of one token on another is quantified by queries and keys. Can we instead augment these with positional embeddings ? Without modifying the mgnitude of the vector, can we encode positional information? \n",
    "\n",
    "**RoPE**: applies rotation in the ($Q$, $K$) embedding space based on the token’s position. Fundamental ideas is to apply sin and cosine positional encoding ot $Q$ and $K$\n",

    "**But why do we group them into two?**\n",
    "\n",
    "RoPE groups embeddings into pairs so each can be rotated in a 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rotation only makes sense in two dimensions:** To rotate, you need an (x, y) pair. Grouping the embedding into 2D pairs lets each pair be rotated by a different frequency (angle) depending on its place in the embedding and the token’s position.\n",
    "* **Maintains periodicity and continuity:** Like sinusoidal PE, RoPE allows the model to learn relative positions and distances, but by literally rotating the embedding in 2D space for each pair.\n",
    "* **Mathematical efficiency:** This rotation preserves the length (norm) of the vector and encodes the position in the direction (angle) of the embedding in 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is the process**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Take the embedding vector** (say of size `d_model`), and **group it into pairs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * (dim 0 & dim 1), (dim 2 & dim 3), ..., (dim d\\_model-2 & dim d\\_model-1)\n",
    "* **Each pair** is treated as a complex number:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For the `k`th pair: `[x_{2k}, x_{2k+1}]` → represents real and imaginary components.\n",
    "* **Apply a rotation** (i.e., multiply by a complex exponential corresponding to the position):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For position `pos`, the rotation angle is based on `pos` and the pair index `k`.\n",
    "  * This is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    [x', y'] = [x*cos(theta) - y*sin(theta), x*sin(theta) + y*cos(theta)]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    where `theta` is the rotation angle for that pair at that position.\n"
